For this assignment, I tried to use video to capture images and alter them and incorporate various forms of interaction. The script uses a constant shader to introduce a large number of variables and functions, including things like turning the image black and white, creating a tile effect, and deciding whether the video is colored or not. The main() function includes a decision variable that detects if the mouse is clicked and the keyboard is pressed, and a function that randomly changes the resolution of the screen when Space is pressed. In this project, the screen is divided by tiles and has a dynamic effect. When the user clicks on the screen, the screen appears reversed and in black and white; adjusting the sliders modifies certain attributes; and pressing Space randomly changes the resolution of the screen. I wanted to create an experience that was full of contrast and variation, so I chose a combination of these effects.

This was an assignment that involved a lot of JavaScript content, which I had little knowledge of in the past, making it quite challenging. I referenced some similar types of projects and parsed the logic, then used my own thinking and understanding to create further work.
